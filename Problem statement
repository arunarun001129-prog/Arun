User Story

Smart Customer Segmentation Platform

As a branch operations manager at a bank, I want a simple customer segmentation tool that helps me classify customers into Platinum, Gold, and silver tiers based on their account value and transaction behaviour, so that I can prioritize relationship management and offer tailored services without needing advanced analytics.

Objective

To develop a basic software module that enables banking teams to segment customers using a simple value-based analysis and manage them accordingly.

Customer Segmentation Logic

Platinum Customers: High-value accounts with frequent transactions - require personalized service and priority support.

Gold Customers: Moderate account value and activity managed with regular engagement.

Silver Customers: Low-value accounts with minimal activity managed with standard services.

Key Features

Login Screen: "Administrator" to set rules, "Branch Manager" to see Dashboard and export data

Rule Engine: Configure rules for classifying customers into Platinum/Gold/Silver tiers.

Automatic Classification: System assigns tier based on defined rules.

Dashboard: Displays segmented customers, their profiles, financials with filters and summary totals.

Export Option: Download customer segmentation data as CSV or PDF for offline use.
